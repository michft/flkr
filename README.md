This is just a little work test to see if I can code in PHP. Done over 24 hours for a publishing company. It takes a search term, submits it to Flickr and returns a paginated result.

The code needs query caching and probably a UI rework, but it's nice and clean and small. Were I writing this from scratch, not answering a PHP question, I would serve all 100 images from the API response and show/hide using javascript.
